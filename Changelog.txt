2024-08-22 v5.0
	-Major updates
	--Less reliant on "innerHTML" because it causes an entire HTML
	  "re-painting" which is very slow and also not recommended due
	  to security reasons.
	--Cleaner JavaScript code, using guard statement (no more
	  MASSIVE indentations) and make use of several JS array methods.
	--Errors on both the AutoAssigner and Addresser can now report
	  or passes multiple error types rather than just stopping
	  before checking on a different error at the same time
	  (previously, if you had errors with syntax and invalid range or
	  length, it reports just the syntax, and not report other
	  errors). It's done via the array.map function, returns an object
	  representing an error of any kind, and let it process all of it,
	  and then report all of them. Only exception is AutoAssigner's
	  gap detection, because it needs all valid info prior to checking
	  overlaps.
	--Negative address supported, if you somehow need addresses
	  located before the earliest one.
	--Address offsetting added, if you need to relocate them to
	  another area. This especially useful for things like mirroring
	  and remapping to SA-1 locations.
	--AutoAssigner now also outputs the resulting RAMs left over.
	--AutoAssigner will now bring up a prominent warning if any define
	  fails to be assigned.
	--Statistics on total bytes (gaps and used addresses) are added.
	-Notes
	--If you are entering an ending address, it is now denoted
	  with a tilde ("~") instead of a hyphen due to negative
	  addressing supported.
2021-05-03 v2.0
	-Released with the changes including a tab function. Thanks
	 to dtothefourth (https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=37441 )

2021-07-03 v3.0
	-This changelog is added.
	-Addresser.html HTML Javascript tool changes:
	--Filtering addresses added.
	---Because of this, a second table (table on the right
	   showing all the gaps) is not needed. Just have only
	   “Gaps” checked on the filter setting.
	--Dark theme, easy on your eyes.
	--Ranges you entered not overlapping will now appear green.
	--A counter display is shown how many were not overlapping,
	  overlapping, or gaps.
	--A plaintext version is also outputted for easy-to-copy and
	  re-entering that onto the JS without editing.
	--The list ignores lines that are blank or have just white
	  spaces, and lines that have 0 or more white space followed
	  by a semicolon, allowing ASM-styled comments.
	--Added an optional feature to ignore duplicate lines, very
	  useful if you accidentally re-enter the same information
	  due to things like 2 separate ASM resources that work
	  together and rely on the same RAM.
	-HowToUse.txt changes:
	--Because of the JS tool now outputs plaintext list, the
	  instruction on how to get all the used RAM is now marked
	  obsolete.
	--Learning a bit more on how a command line console works
	  with asar, it is possible output a list of used RAM as a
	  txt file and the JS tool will accept that. I was hoping
	  this will be a game changer for future ASM submissions
	  to do that for anyone not knowing how to manage their
	  memory use.
2021-07-04 Escape tag option and warn the user about improper HTML tag setup for description
	-I discovered a major issue and have fixed them regarding
	 HTML tags in the description:
	--Improper tag setup like ending the table tags without
	  starting them beforehand can break the outer table.
	--Added a setting that will escape HTML tags and the
	  escape character itself (the ampersand), when enabled,
	  will disable the HTML effects, which prevents breaking
	  the table.
2021-12-24 v4.0
	-Redid the entire code and optimizations and other functions
	 for Addresser2.html and small changes to the original.
	 (kept the original in case someone still wants it)
	-what's new for Addresser2.html 
	--It has a better overlap detection no longer requiring a
	  sort-increasing-address (uses a 1-dimensional “axis-aligned
	  bounding box” check). You can maintain the same order as
	  you enter the list of used RAM
	--When RAM usages overlap, they now have a list of things
	  they conflict with.
	--Graphical chart mode added (“Byte by byte address view”).
	  This displays each byte of consecutive address with bars
	  indicating known used address and gaps in between. It
	  shifts to the right and colors them red when overlaps
	  are found.
	-Big new thing added: Ram_AutoAssigner.html This lets the
	 user automatically assign freeram defines to any currently
	 unused RAM. Enter a list of freeram defines and gaps generated
	 by the addresser tools and it will output a list of defines
	 with the RAMs to use.
