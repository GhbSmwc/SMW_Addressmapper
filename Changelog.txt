2021-07-03 v3.0
	-This changelog is added.
	-Addresser.html HTML Javascript tool changes:
	--Filtering addresses added.
	---Because of this, a second table (table on the right
	   showing all the gaps) is not needed. Just have only
	   “Gaps” checked on the filter setting.
	--Dark theme, easy on your eyes.
	--Ranges you entered not overlapping will now appear green.
	--A counter display is shown how many were not overlapping,
	  overlapping, or gaps.
	--A plaintext version is also outputted for easy-to-copy and
	  re-entering that onto the JS without editing.
	--The list ignores lines that are blank or have just white
	  spaces, and lines that have 0 or more white space followed
	  by a semicolon, allowing ASM-styled comments.
	--Added an optional feature to ignore duplicate lines, very
	  useful if you accidentally re-enter the same information
	  due to things like 2 separate ASM resources that work
	  together and rely on the same RAM.
	-HowToUse.txt changes:
	--Because of the JS tool now outputs plaintext list, the
	  instruction on how to get all the used RAM is now marked
	  obsolete.
	--Learning a bit more on how a command line console works
	  with asar, it is possible output a list of used RAM as a
	  txt file and the JS tool will accept that. I was hoping
	  this will be a game changer for future ASM submissions
	  to do that for anyone not knowing how to manage their
	  memory use.
2021-07-04 Escape tag option and warn the user about improper HTML tag setup for description
	-I discovered a major issue and have fixed them regarding
	 HTML tags in the description:
	--Improper tag setup like ending the table tags without
	  starting them beforehand can break the outer table.
	--Added a setting that will escape HTML tags and the
	  escape character itself (the ampersand), when enabled,
	  will disable the HTML effects, which prevents breaking
	  the table.
